	<h1>Stage 0 Notes:</h1>

	<h2>WWW</h2>
	<p><b>WWW</b> is short for World Wide Web. The World Wide Web is a collection of html documents. Each docuent is made up of HTML or hypertext markup language, which is the basis for almost every web page on the internet, the glue.</p>
	<p>Each paged is linked together via <a href="http://www.udacity.com">hyperlinks</a> and this is what makes the web, web-like.</p>
	<p>Invented in the 1990's and has around 30 Billion pages and growing exponentially.</p>

	<h2>HTML Basics</h2>
	<h3>What is it made up off?</h3>
	<p>Text content - which is what you see on the page.<br> Markup - the visual.<br> Links to other docs such as images and videos.</p>

    <h3>HTML Elements</h3>
    <p>HTML is <b>reasonably straightforward</b></p>
    <p>the <"b"> tag makes words bold</p>
    <p>I am going to <em>learn</em> to <b>love</b> HTML. 
    <p>The <"em"> tag makes words <em>italic</em></p>

    <h3>Attributes</h3>
    <p><"a"> (anchor) tag is used for link</p>
    <p>"href" is the attribute name for a link. This is where you provide the url which points to the page you want to visit on the web</p>
    <p><"img"> tag is used for images </p>
    <p>"src" is the attribute name for an image.</p>
    <p>This is an example of using <a href="http://www.udacity.com">links</a> and images <img src="http://www.udacity.com/cs253x/hipmunk.png" alt="hipmunk"> in HTML.</p>

    <h2>Inline vs Block</h2>
    <p>p tag is a block element, which gets wrapped with a HTML box and starts a new line.<p>
    <p>Where as the "br" tag is an inline element, does <b>NOT</b> get wrapped with a HTML box,<br> but behaves similarly by creating a new line afer the tag.</p>
    <br>
    <span>The span tag is an inline element that just holds content which can be styled</span>
    <div>The div tag is a block element that just holds content which can be styled as well.</div>
