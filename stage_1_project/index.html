                <h2>Inline vs Block</h2>
                <p>&lt;p&gt; tag is a block element, which gets wrapped with a HTML box and starts a new line.<p>
                <p>Where as the &lt;br&gt; tag is an inline element, does <b>NOT</b> get wrapped with a HTML box,<br> but behaves similarly by creating a new line afer the tag.</p>
                <p>The &lt;span&gt; tag is an inline element that just holds content which can be styled</p>
                <p>The &lt;div&gt; tag is a block element that just holds content which can be styled as well.</p>
